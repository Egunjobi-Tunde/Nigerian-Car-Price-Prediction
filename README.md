## Predicting Car Prices: A Data-driven Approach

**Introduction:**
When it comes to buying or selling a car, accurately estimating its price is crucial. To simplify this process and provide reliable price predictions, we have developed a car price prediction system using machine learning. This innovative solution leverages advanced algorithms and a comprehensive dataset to help users estimate the value of a vehicle based on its characteristics.

**Methodology:**

1. Data Cleaning:
The first step in our project was to clean the dataset. This involved removing any duplicate entries, handling missing values, and addressing inconsistencies in the data. By ensuring the quality and integrity of the dataset

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Next, I performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. I visualized the data, analyzed the distributions, and explored correlations between car features and prices. This process helped in identifying significant patterns and make informed decisions during the feature engineering stage.

3. Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering is a crucial step in building predictive models. I carefully selected relevant features from the dataset and engineered new ones to capture important information. For example, we extracted information from the car's make, condition, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and transmission to create meaningful features that could influence the price. By transforming and combining these features, we enhanced the predictive power of our models.

4. Model Building:
With the preprocessed and engineered dataset in hand, I proceeded to build machine learning models. I selected three powerful algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost and linear regression. Random forest and XGBoost are known for their ability to handle complex relationships and capture non-linear patterns, while linear regression provides a baseline model for comparison. I trained these models and ensure optimal performance.

5. Deployment:
The final step of the project was to deploy the car price prediction system. I utilized Gradio, a user-friendly Python library, to create an interactive interface that allows users to input the details of a car and obtain a predicted price. This deployment enables users to access the system easily and benefit from its price estimation capabilities.
